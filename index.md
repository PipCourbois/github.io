# Pip's Pages

I was laid off from Groupon on April 6, 2020.  This was expected as Corona (Covid-19) just destroyed Groupon's business model, and we had to implement draconian cost-cutting measures.  As a Principal Data Scientist in Marketing, I was not necessary to keeping the lights on.  I wanted to take advantage of the time off to learn new skills.  Over the past few years the tools and algorithms that power Data Science have changed significantly and Groupon did not keep up.  Under my guidance we were building the infrastructure to take advantage of the new tools but then Corona hit.

These pages are my ferloughed journey through the new tools in Data Science.
